# Autonomous Football Field Marking Robot

### Design. Build. Automate.

A Mechatronics Engineering project focused on autonomous navigation and precision field marking using robotics and intelligent control systems.

---

## Introduction

Field marking in football pitches is a time-consuming and precision-critical task. Traditional methods require manual measurement, steady handling, and several hours of labor.

BOTMARK proposes the design and development of a reduced-scale autonomous robot capable of navigating a football field and painting regulation-compliant lines using integrated positioning, sensing, and control systems.

The goal is to combine:

- Mechanical robustness  
- Accurate dispensing mechanisms  
- Autonomous path execution
